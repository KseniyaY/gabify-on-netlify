Realtime Chat App (React &amp; NodeJS &amp; Socket.io)

### [App Site](https://gabify-on.netlify.app/)

## Introduction:
This is a code repository for the realtime chat application built with the help of React, NodeJS and Socket.io. 
The use of any database for storage of a chat history, as well as user authorization and security measures, were not foreseen in this small test project, therefore not implemented. Yet to be developed as soon as priority list in terms of other experimental web projects is caught up and kept up. ;)
This project deployed on Heroku and Netflify as platforms for backend and frontend, correspondingly.

## Setup:
run ``` npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server.
